## FAQs
### What is the optimal temperature for reptiles?
The optimal temperature for reptiles depends on their species and habitat. Different reptile species have different temperature requirements, so it's important to research and understand your pet's specific needs. As a general rule, most reptiles require a basking spot with a temperature range of 85-95째F (29-35째C) during the day, and a cooler area with a temperature range of 70-80째F (21-27째C) at night. Some reptiles, such as desert-dwelling species, may require even higher temperatures, while others, such as those that live in cooler climates, may require lower temperatures.

### What is UVB lighting and why is it important for reptiles?

UVB lighting is a type of light that provides ultraviolet B radiation, which is important for reptile health. UVB radiation helps reptiles to synthesize vitamin D3, which is essential for proper calcium absorption and healthy bone development. Without adequate UVB exposure, reptiles can develop metabolic bone disease, a serious condition that can cause deformities, fractures, and even death. It's important to provide UVB lighting for your pet reptile, and to replace the bulbs regularly to ensure they are providing adequate UVB radiation.

### Can I use a regular light bulb as a heat source for my reptile?

No, it's not recommended to use a regular light bulb as a heat source for your reptile. Regular light bulbs do not emit the type of heat and light that reptiles need, and can actually be harmful to their health. Instead, it's important to use a specialized reptile heat bulb or heating pad designed specifically for reptile use. These products provide the appropriate type of heat and light to keep your reptile healthy and happy.
