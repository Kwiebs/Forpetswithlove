Salmon, often referred to as the "king of fish," is not only a delicious treat for humans but also an excellent choice for our furry companions. Packed with omega-3 fatty acids, salmon provides numerous benefits for skin and coat health. These fatty acids help reduce inflammation, moisturize the skin, and promote a shiny coat.

Turkey, a lean and protein-rich meat, is another fantastic option for improving your pet's skin and coat health. Turkey contains essential nutrients like zinc and vitamin B, which play a vital role in maintaining healthy skin. Zinc aids in cell regeneration and supports the immune system, while vitamin B promotes a soft and silky coat.
