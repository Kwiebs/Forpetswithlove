## Introduction

As responsible pet owners, we are always seeking ways to enhance the health and happiness of our beloved dogs. [CBD](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cbd+for+dogs&crid=3NGM5VIVMQXWA&sprefix=cbd+for+dogs%2Caps%2C275&linkCode=ll2&tag=forpetswith01-20&linkId=dbef82d5dfa870bde92d563c595ca287&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), a natural compound derived from the hemp plant, offers a holistic approach to pet care. It interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the body, which plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and regulating various physiological functions.

### How Does CBD Work for Dogs?

The ECS is a complex network of receptors found throughout the body of mammals, including dogs. CBD interacts with these receptors, primarily the CB1 and CB2 receptors, to stimulate a variety of therapeutic effects. Unlike THC, another compound found in cannabis, CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it does not produce a "high" effect.
