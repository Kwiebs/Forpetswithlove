It uses a sensor or timer to detect when the cat has used the box and automatically rakes the litter, removing any waste into a separate compartment. Here are some of the pros and cons of a self-cleaning litter box:

### Pros:

Consider your cat's behavior, preferences, and habits when choosing a litter box, and take into account the pros and cons of each type. With this information, you'll be able to choose the best litter box for your furry friend and ensure their comfort and happiness.
